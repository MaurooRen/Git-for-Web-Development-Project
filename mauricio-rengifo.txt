           what you delete with in terminal you are not able to recover.

    34. Why should I use version control? 
        -> so you can avoid naming files like this: final, final_final, final_v3, f*ck_final_version_ever, final_v4

           our current code with some point in the past and colaborate in a sigle project with multiple developers.

        -> that depend, the first time we are supposed to:

           git push name-of-my-branch

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
        -> Steps:
            1. Open the github repo that you wanna contribute or just Copy
            2. Fork the repo
            3. Be sure sure you are located now in your own version of the repo you just fork
            4. Go to the botton "Copy" (shoul be green) and copy the URL under HTTPS, save it, you will need it later.
            5. go do your terminal and locate yourself inside the folder where you wanna copy those files
            6. write in the comman like "git clone url-that-you-just-copy" and press enter
            7. if its your first time will ask you for your github login info, just write it!
            8. (make the changes that you need)
            9. after you have saved all the chages we have to use the following command to be sure git recognize the changes "git status"
               you will see some file in red, that good.
            10.use the command "git add ." this will recognice all the changes and save it into git
            11.now use "git commit -m "hey mom, now im a programmer" to create a descriptive comment about what changes you did
            12.then use "git push -u origin nameOfYourBranch" to submit everything to github
            13.then go to the github folder that you fork, your version not the original, and go to "pull request" and create one

 
Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        -> the diferent between display: inline and display: block its how we want to position or elements or list, example
            if we have a UL and many Li inside and we apply 'inline' we are gonna have every item next to the other, like reading order
            if we use for the same list 'block' every item its gonna turn into an individual line, one under the other.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        -> its gonna ignore where its located and place and place it self on top of all other elements

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        -> I struggle with this question, but i think that I get it:
           when we want that an element use just the space it need we have to apply the property display:inline-block in that way will work,
           take H1 as an example, by defuld its gonna be display: block; and width that we can apply the size that we want it.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        -> block: <div> <section> <h1>
           inline: <span> <i>
           inline-block: <input>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        -> when we talk about the box model it refer to how we can abstrac html elements and visuallice them as a box, we can apply properties like: margin, padding,
        and border and its allways going to be a box, unless we use border-radius: 100%; but that a diferent story.
        
        display:fix; will mean that we wanna position that element on a fix/static posicion of a web page, example: { display: fix; top: 0; left: 0; }
        will position or element on the left top of the windows on top of everything else.
